## Required Inputs
* TCGA HRC Imputed Genotyping Data
   * Access to the pre-processed quality controlled (QC), stranded and imputed genotyping data ("Sayaman et al TCGA QC HRC Imputed Genotyping Data") requires GDC controlled access permission approval.
   * The quality controlled and HRC imputed genotyping data were contributed towards ancestry analyses in Carrot-Zhang et al., Cancer Cell 2020, and are accessible at the GDC publication page: https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/CCG-AIM-2020
      * Folder: "TCGA QC HRC Imputed Genotyping Data used by the AIM AWG (from Sayaman et al)"
        * Subfolder: "HRC Imputed Genotyping Data"
  * Download and read the READ_ME_4.txt file.
  * Dowload contents of the folder -- e.g., chr*.zip files, into the github folder: ./GitHub/TCGA_PanCancer_Immune_Genetics/Data/HRC_Imputed_Genotyping_Data
* Mapping of Birdseed file IDs and TCGA patient IDs: tcga_imputed_hrc1.1.updateid.TCGAID.txt


## Required Software
* bcftools
* tabix
* plink (PLINK v1.90b5): https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/


## Contents
1. Unzip HRC Imputed Genotyping Data. Data is password protected (see READ_ME_4.txt).
    * qsub_unzip_HRC_chr.txt

2. Filter chr*.dose.vcf.gz files for R2 ≥ 0.5 and index. Generates chr*.rsq0.5.dose.vcf.gz and chr*.rsq0.5.dose.vcf.gz.tbi files.
    * qsub_filter_vcf_R2.txt

3. Filter chr*.info.gz files for R2 ≥ 0.5. Generates chr*.info.rsq0.5.gz files. Requires the Format_Impute_HRC_Info_chr1.py file.
    * qsub_make_py_format_info.txt - Generates a Format_Impute_HRC_Info_chr*.py file per chr from Format_Impute_HRC_Info_chr1.py template
    * qsub_py_format_info.txt - Runs Format_Impute_HRC_Info_chr*.py files

4. Convert VCF chr*.rsq0.5.dose.vcf.gz files to PLINK tcga_imputed_hrc1.1_rsq0.5_chr*.bed files
    * qsub_convert_vcf_plink.txt - Generates tcga_imputed_hrc1.1_rsq0.5_chr*.bed, .bim, .fam plink files

5. Make new SNP id for the PLINK bim file. Requires the Format_Create_NewMarkerID_for_Bim_chr1.py file.
    * qsub_make_py_format_snpid.txt - Generates a Format_Create_NewMarkerID_for_Bim_chr*.py per chr from Format_Create_NewMarkerID_for_Bim_chr1.py template
    * qsub_py_format_snpid.txt - Runs Format_Create_NewMarkerID_for_Bim_chr*.py files

6. Update IIDs and FIDs in the PLINK fam file from Birdseed file IDs to TCGA patient IDs. Requires the tcga_imputed_hrc1.1.updateid.TCGAID.txt file.
    * qsub_plink_update_ids.txt - Generates plink files with an updated tcga_imputed_hrc1.1_rsq0.5_TCGAID_chr*.fam file
