## TCGA QC and Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) Imputed Genotyping Data

**Note:** Please cite Sayaman et al., Immunity 2021 and Carrot-Zhang et al., Cancer Cell 2020 when using the quality controlled and HRC imputed genotyping data. 

1.	Download TCGA QC and HRC Imputed Genotyping Data 

    a.	The TCGA QC and HRC imputed genotyping data generated in (Sayaman et al., 2021) were contributed towards ancestry analyses  (Carrot-Zhang et al., 2020) and are accessible at the GDC publication page under Supplemental Data Files section (https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/CCG-AIM-2020). 

    b.	Download the open-access files from the “TCGA QC HRC Imputed Genotyping Data used by the AIM AWG from (Sayaman et al., 2021) section of the “Supplemental Data Files”:

    i.	Information on composition of genotyping files
