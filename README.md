## Resources
1. TCGA QC'd and HRC Imputed Genotyping Data  
   * Access to the TCGA original birdseed and pre-processed quality controlled genotyping data imputed to HRC generated in the current manuscript ("Sayaman et al TCGA QC HRC Imputed Genotyping Data") requires GDC controlled access permission approval.
   * The quality controlled and HRC imputed genotyping data and the UCSF ancestry assignments were contributed towards ancestry analyses (Carrot-Zhang et al., 2020) and are accessible at the GDC publication page (https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/CCG-AIM-2020).
     * Folder: "TCGA QC HRC Imputed Genotyping Data used by the AIM AWG (from Sayaman et al)"
       * Subfolder: "HRC Imputed Genotyping Data"
   * Download and read the READ_ME_4.txt file.
   * Controlled Access data include:
     * QC'd Unimputed Genotyping Data
     * HRC Stranded Unimputed Genotyping Data
