# TCGA_PanCancer_Immune_Genetics

Last updated: 03/07/2022

## Description
Germline genetic variants shape immune response and may explain some of the immunological heterogeneity observed across patients’ tumors. We present a workflow to assess the contribution of hosts’ genetic background to the immune landscape of solid tumors using harmonized data from more than 9000 patients enrolled in the TCGA. The protocol is developed around the structure of TCGA, but it can be adapted to explore other repositories, for instance in the context of cancer immunotherapy.

The code and data deposited here were used to generate the results and resource files for the Sayaman, Saad et al., 2021 paper.

## Contents
**Apply for dbGaP Authorization**
 
 
## Workflow
**Timing: 1-3 weeks**

1.	To apply for dbGAP, an institutional account is required.

2.	Apply for dbGaP authorization to access TCGA controlled-access data: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=login

3.	 Prepare a data access request: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/GetPdf.cgi?document_name=GeneralAAInstructions.pdf

**Critical:** dbGAP authorization is necessary to access germline data. Preparing the application is fast, however, as the review process of the application can take some time, this step should be started as soon as possible.
